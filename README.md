🏡 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on property and location features using three different machine learning algorithms:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest

Linear Regression

The goal is to compare model performance and identify the best approach for accurate house price prediction.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various features that influence house prices, such as:

Lot size

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Square footage

Location details

Year built

(Replace with dataset source link if public)
