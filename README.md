# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on property and location features using three different machine learning algorithms:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Random Forest

- Linear Regression

The goal is to compare model performance and identify the best approach for accurate house price prediction.


# 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various features that influence house prices, such as:

- Lot size

- Number of bedrooms 

- Square footage

- Location details

- Year built
  

# 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing:

- Handling missing values

- Encoding categorical variables

- Feature scaling

- Model training using SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression
  

# 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook



# 📌 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy

- Deploy model via Flask or Streamlit for interactive web usage
